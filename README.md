Architecture components : Room exploration 
=========================
 
 Most of us know how to use room database for android development. Instead of basic functionalities, will expolre more intresting and important features that could help us in app development.

What we explore
-------------------------

1. Relations – In designing a relational database, splitting data into related table and get data together in meaningful way is important. Room supports all possible relations between tables : 1 to 1, 1 to many & many to many with on annotation @Relation.
    
    * One to One relation
    * One to Many relation
    * Many to Many relation
    
2. SQL Join – A JOIN clause is used to combine two or more tables, based on related column.
